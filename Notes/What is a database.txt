-We will be using MySQL
-A Database (DB) is a collection of related information
for example: phone book, shopping list, facebook's user base
-Databases can be stored in different ways, for example: on paper, on a computer
-Database Managemente Systems (DBMS): Special software program that helps users
create and maintain a Database
    -makes it easy to managae large amounts of information
    -handles security
    -backups
    -importing/expoting data 
    -concurrency
    -interacts with software applications
        -programming languages
-CRUD Create, Read, Update, Delete
-two main type of databases:
    -relational (SQL)
        -uses tables
        -each table has columns and rows
        -a unique key identifies each row
    -non relational (noSQL/not just SQL)
        -organize data in anything but a traditional table
        -key-value stores
        -documents
        -graphs
        -flexible tables
-Relational databases can use a relational database management system (RDBMS) to 
help create and maintain a relational database, for example:
    -MySQL
    -Oracle
    -postgreSQL
    -mariaDB
-SQL
    -Standardized language for interacting with RDBMS
    -used to perform CRUD operations as well as other administrative tasks (user 
    management, security, backup, etc)
    -used to define tables and structures
    -SQL code used on one RDBMS is not always portable to another without 
    modification
-Non relational database management systems (NRDBMS) help users create and maintain 
a non relational database
    -mongoDB, dynamoDB, apache cassandra, firebase, etc.
    -implementation specific meaning there's no set language Standard
    -Most NRDBMS will implement their own language for performing CRUD and 
    administrative operations on the database.
-Database queries are requests made to the database management system for specific
information
-As the database's structure becomes more and more complex, it becomes more difficult
to get the specific pieces of information we want
-basically relational uses SQL and non relational uses other data structures
