-How do we store information?
-in tables, we need to know about keys and rows and columns and relationships
-lets say we have a simple student table, it has 3 columns, 6 rows
-A column is a single atribute and a row represents a single entry
-we want primary keys, they uniquely define a row entry
-in the rows student id, name, and major, student id is the primary key since it
cannot have a duplicate
-in a user table with columns like email, password, date_created, and type,
email would be the primary key
-about primary keys: some are surrogate keys (dont realte to the real
world) others are natural keys (do relate to the real world)
-Foreign key: stores the primary key of a row in an other table
-Foreign keys help us define relationships between tables
-A row uniquely defined by two columns is using a composite key as a 
primary key
