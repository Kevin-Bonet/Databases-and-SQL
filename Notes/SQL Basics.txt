-SQl is a language used for interacting with RDBMS
-SQL tells the RDBMS to:
    -create, retrieve, update and delete data
    -create and manage databases
    -design and create database tables
    -Perform administration tasks (security, 
    user management, import/export, etc.)
-SQL implementations vary between systems
-Concepts remains the same, but the implementation may vary
-SQL is 4 languages in one:
    1) Data query language (get information/data)
    2) Data definition language (define schema)
    3) Data control language (controlling access to the data)
    4) Data manipulation language (interting, updating and deleting data)
-Queries: set of instructions given to the RDBMS (in SQL) that tell the
RDBMS what information you want it to retrive for you
    -parse through a huge amount of complex data and get exactly what
    you need
    -Example:
    SELECT employee.name, employee.age
    FROM employee
    WHERE employee.salary > 30000;
